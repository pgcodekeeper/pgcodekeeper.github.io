      <li>SQL code generation has been changed. All SQL statements are now created for <i>search_path = pg_catalog</i>. This improves security and stability of generated code, for more information see <a href='https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/release-10-3.html#id-1.11.6.6.5'>PostgreSQL 10.3 changelog</a>.<br>

      <li><a href='https://github.com/pgcodekeeper/pg_dbo_timestamp/releases/tag/v1.0.0'><i>pg_dbo_timestamp</i></a> extension has been updated to work around the issue of object privilege tracking.
