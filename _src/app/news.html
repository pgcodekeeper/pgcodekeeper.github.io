      <li>Option to create markers of SQL syntax errors, detected by the parser, has been added. Errant files are
        marked in the project tree, errant places are underlined in pgCodeKeeper SQL editor (enable pgCodeKeeper
        SQL editor by clicking the file SQL — Open With — pgCodeKeeper SQL editor with a right mouse button). For
        updating markers in the project make sure that pgCodeKeeper builder is enabled (how to enable: click the
        project with a right mouse button — select pgCodeKeeper, then — Add builder).
      </li>
      <li>pgCodeKeeper builder operation has been improved: frequent updating and smooth progress bar displaying.</li>
